## Motivation

As a team, we aimed to create a web application where users who are on the job hunt and want to stay organized in their pursuit of employment. We wanted the users to be able to add jobs that they are interested in and pertinent information regarding those jobs. The user can keep track of all the jobs they are looking at and see a calendar with any important dates that are approaching. The design concept is simple, easy to navigate, and consistent across all pages.
